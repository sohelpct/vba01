Doing Vba Coding to simplify a business

My Client's requirement:
____________________________________________________________________
He Sohel, The sheet looks nice.. A couple of questions...
1. is it possible to hide the tabs and only show the HOME tab. Using only the buttons inside of the home page to navigate to the other pages? If that's possible that would be great. Because, getting my people to navigate using the arrows or Ctr-H may be cumbersome..
2. When I open the sheet it's saying "This workbook contains links to one or more external sources that could be unsafe...... when I press update it says "we can't update some of the links in your workbook right now." Then when I press Edit Links it's pulling up the AUV template worksheet A the Status says Source not found? I'm not sure if this is because of the way I downloaded it or not? any thoughts?
3. Once I pass that error message it says "That command cannot be performed while a protected sheet contains another Pivot/Table report based on the same source data.

Other than that, the sheet works nice.. I like where it's going.. Let me know if these are needed or a way to bypass the messages...

Thanks!

Hi Boss,

Pls find the updated worksheets as per your instruction.

+ include additional sheets into the master sheet
+ do hidden sheet shot-cuts
+ fix-up opening message errors

Thanks to get your kind review.
